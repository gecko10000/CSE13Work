# Getting Acquainted with Unix and C

This program creates three `collatz.pdf` files and populates them with graphs showing patterns in the Collatz sequence.

To run the program, simply type `$ ./plot.sh`.

This will generate the PDF documents with the graphs, along with internal files (compiled C binaries via the `Makefile` and temporary data storage files for `gnuplot` to use)
